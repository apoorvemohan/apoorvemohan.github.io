<h1>Bio</h1>
<p align="justify">
  I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the ECE Department, College of Engineering, Northeastern University since Fall 2014. Broadly, I am interested in <b><i>systems and networking</i></b>.
<!--My current research revolves around improving efficiency, security, and operation of <b><i>bare-metal clouds</i></b>.-->
<br/>
<br/>
Current research focuses on <b><i>improving bare-metal resource efficiency</i></b>, which includes the following projects: (a)~enabling rapid and secure time-multiplexing of bare-metal servers across co-located clusters to improve aggregate resource effiency in centralized data centers; (b)~non-intrusive software and configuration introspection strategy for bare-metal clusters; (c)~node-level co-location strategy for latency-tolerant jobs that leverages user-space application-transparent checkpoint-restart mechanism to improve throughput in batch clusters.
