<h2>Thesis Proposal</h2>

 <h3>Title: Strategies to Improve Operation and Usage of Bare-Metal
Clusters</h3>

 <b>Abstract</b>
  <p class="content">
Over the last decade, organizations have realized the advantages of having a data-driven enterprise. To run their business, they invest enormous sums of money to buy or rent infrastructure and set up and manage bare-metal clusters. It is essential for them to efficiently operate and use these bare-metal clusters to maximize their returns on the investment. However, there continues to exist the following issues that lead to inefficient operation and usage of bare-metal infrastructure, despite the intense research in this area:
 </p>


<ul>
<li><p class="content"> <b>Elasticity:</b> Existing general-purpose bare-metal provisioning techniques provision the intended software stack on the local storage present on a bare-metal server. Provisioning bare-metal servers to their local storage hampers the speed at which they can be added and removed from a cluster.
 </p></li>
 
<li><p class="content"> <b>Introspectability:</b> Introspection of the locally-provisioned software stack for vulnerabilities and malware requires periodic execution of an introspection agent on a bare-metal server. However, an agent-based introspection approach has several problems. First, the integrity of the agent remains questionable as a co-located rogue process can influence the information that the agent reports. Next, the complexity of managing such agents grows with the scale of the cluster. Moreover, such agents are also infamous for inducing severe performance jitter in the system when they are active, which can impact many performance-sensitive workloads.
 </p></li>

<li><p class="content"> <b>Aggregate Resource Usage:</b> Today, organizations host multiple bare-metal clusters in their data centers. However, they do not perform opportunistic short-term multiplexing of underutilized bare-metal servers between the co-located clusters to improve their aggregate resource usage. These clusters are provisioned locally and siloed from each other, which significantly increases the cost and complexity of multiplexing bare-metal servers, and thus makes it hard to exploit any short-term multiplexing opportunity.
 </p></li>

<li><p class="content"> <b>Job Co-scheduling:</b> Many organizations allow co-scheduling of jobs in their throughput-oriented batch clusters. However, co-scheduling of jobs contending for the same system resources can impact their performance, and hence degrade the cluster throughput. Furthermore, in the case of bad co-scheduling decisions, the recovery strategies chosen by existing systems will be sub-optimal; as they do not take account of the opportunity to migrate jobs between cluster nodes using process migration techniques. 
</p></li>
</ul>

  <p class="content">
This thesis focuses on general-purpose and workload-agnostic strategies, which improves elasticity, introspectability, aggregate resource usage, and co-scheduling of batch jobs in bare-metal clusters.
